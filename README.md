# SLC6_lipid_fingerprints

MARTINI models used to investigate the lipid fingerprints of
SLC6 transporters in both a complex neuronal plasma membrane and a
simple POPC/CHOL membrane are in data/.

The neuronal plasma membrane is based on:

Ingólfsson, H. I.; Carpenter, T. S.; Bhatia, H.; Bremer, P. T.; Marrink, S. J.; Lightstone, F. C. Computational Lipidomics of the Neuronal Plasma Membrane. Biophys. J. 2017, 113 (10), 2271–2280.

Scripts to run the analyses to obtain the area per lipid (mapl),
lipid depletion-enrichment index (mdei),
and lipid flop-flop (mflipflop) are in the scripts folder.

Please see the [slc6-transporters](https://github.com/lilyminium/mdanalysis/tree/slc6-transporters/package/MDAnalysis/analysis/leaflets) branch of Lily Wang's MDAnalysis repository
for the actual implementation of each analyses.
